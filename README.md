It help us to open sas files in python

SAS creates and uses a variety of specially structured files called SAS files. Although Windows manages the file for SAS by storing it, the operating system cannot process it. For example, you can list SAS files with the Windows Explorer, but SAS files must be processed by SAS. SAS files are different from external files. External files can be processed by SAS statements and commands, they are not managed by SAS.
